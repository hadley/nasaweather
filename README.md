# NASA weather data

"The data are geographic and atmospheric measures on a very coarse 24 by 24 grid covering Central America. The variables are: elevation, temperature (surface and air), ozone, air pressure, and cloud cover (low, mid, and high). With the exception of elevation, all variables are monthly averages, with observations for Jan 1995 to Dec 2000. These data were obtained from the NASA Langley Research Center Atmospheric Sciences Data Center". --- [2006 ASA stat computing and graphics expo](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/dataexpo/dataexpo2006).

This package contains four datasets:

* `atmos`: atmospheric measurements
* `elev`: elevations
* `borders`: borders of countries in the region
